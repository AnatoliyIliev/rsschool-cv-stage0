## Code examples
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

```
function friend(friends) {
  let allFriends = [];
  const myFriends = friends.map(friend => {
    if (friend.length === 4) {
      allFriends.push(friend);
      return allFriends;
    }
  });
  return allFriends;
}

console.log(friend(['Ryan', 'Kieran', 'Mark'])); 
// ['Ryan', 'Mark']

```
